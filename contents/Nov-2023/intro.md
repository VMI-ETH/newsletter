Dear VMI members,

Although the autumn semester already started last month, it's now finally feeling like autumn! 

We have so many events planned for you this month - for example, the all-time classic [Running Dinner](#running-dinner) (if you don't know what this is, we encourage you to read on).
Moreover, we are looking for volunteers to help running this department and VMI - make sure to read the announcements!

Finally, if you're interested in what we got up to during our annual summer retreat, check out our [Summer Retreat 2023 Retrospective](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2023/10/11/summer-retreat-retrospective/).

We wish you a cosy November!

-- Your VMI Board
