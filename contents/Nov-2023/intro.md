Dear VMI members,

Although the autumn semester has already started last month, we finally have a what-feels-like autumn.
Last month, we wrote a [Summer Retreat 2023 Retrospective](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2023/10/11/summer-retreat-retrospective/), and we have a lot of events coming up!

For example, the all-time classic [Running Dinner](#running-dinner) (if you don't know what this is, we encourage you to read on)!

Moreover, we are looking for volunteers to help running this department and VMI!
Make sure to read the announcements.

We wish you a cozy November!

-- Your VMI Board
