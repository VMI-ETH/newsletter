### Welcome Event

**November 1, [CAB Food&Lab](https://ethz.ch/en/campus/getting-to-know/cafes-restaurants-shops/gastronomy/restaurants-and-cafeterias/zentrum/food-lab.html), 17:30**

We cordially invite all D-INFK scientific staff who joined within the last year to our annual Welcome Event! It's a great chance to get to know the department and VMI (your scientific staff association), meet fellow new staff members, and enjoy an apÃ©ro together.

Meet us in Food&Lab for an introduction to VMI, followed by two parallel keynote talks: new PhD students will hear from Prof. Markus PÃ¼schel, and new postdocs from Prof. Kenny Paterson. They'll give insights and helpful tips on making the most of your time at D-INFK - including organising your research and teaching responsibilities, the research plan and aptitude colloquium, opportunities for career development, and much more. 

Following this, we'll reconvene for an apÃ©ro, where you can meet some fellow new scientific staff!
