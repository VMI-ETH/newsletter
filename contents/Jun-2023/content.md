### Summer Retreat 2023

**September 9-12 and 14-17, Laax, Switzerland**

Every year, VMI hosts our famous Summer Retreat, which brings together D-INFK scientific staff for 4 days of fun, networking, science and learning. This year's Summer Retreat will be in Laax. The retreat is fully supported by the department, so there's no need to take vacation days to attend. 

We're excited to announce that sign up is now open. [Register here](https://forms.gle/gcc6sSGcd7KFQ8Q76) before **June 15**!

To see what we got up to in previous years, have a look at the [2022](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2022/09/27/summer-retreat-retrospective/) and [2021](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2022/02/21/summer-retreat-retrospective/) retreat retrospectives.
