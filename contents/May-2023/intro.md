Dear VMI members,

In May, the VMI running dinner is coming back, and this time, it'll be a joint event with the Department of Mathematics.
We would love to see you there!

Also, we're excited to share some fun events happening around ETH with you.

We wish you a lovely springtime!

-- Your VMI Board
