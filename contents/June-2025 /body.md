As researchers at ETH, we're constantly connected‚Äîemails, pings, documents, and data are just a click away. But without boundaries, this always-on state can drain focus and energy. This month's well-being tip is about the importance of **Digital Boundaries**‚Äîprotecting your attention in a hyper-connected world.

**Set Screen-Free Zones:** Designate times or places where screens are off-limits, like during lunch or the first 30 minutes after waking. These mini breaks from tech can reset your nervous system and improve mental clarity.

**Mute with Purpose:** Not every notification needs your attention right now. Customize alerts and set ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù periods so you can dive deeper into tasks without constant interruptions.

**Single-Task the Digital Way:** It‚Äôs tempting to tab-hop, but try closing extra windows or using full-screen mode to focus on one thing at a time. Your brain will thank you with sharper thinking and less stress.

**Fun Fact:** Studies show that even the presence of a phone on your desk can reduce cognitive performance. Out of sight really can mean more peace of mind!

**Protect your focus‚Äîit‚Äôs one of your most valuable resources.**
