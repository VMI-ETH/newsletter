### Tips of the month: Prioritize Sleep for Better Productivity

As researchers, it’s easy to sacrifice sleep for late-night coding, paper deadlines, or debugging sessions. However, sleep is essential for memory consolidation, problem-solving, and maintaining focus.

* Set a Sleep Schedule: Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night.
* Wind Down Before Bed: Avoid screens 30 minutes before bedtime.
* Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment: Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.

**Fun Fact**: During sleep, your brain clears out toxins and consolidates memories—think of it as your brain’s nightly "debugging" session!
