### VMI Summer Retreat 2024

Planning of the summer retreat 2024 has begun, and we aim to have the summer retreat at the Wellness Hostel 4000 at Saas-Fee!
Evidently, this hostel will be 33% better than last year's Wellness Hostel 3000 (though, some wonder how this can even be possible).

The VMI summer retreat is a great opportunity to get to know other researchers at the department, visit a beautiful part of Switzerland, and have some fun.
It offers a mix of scientific and leisure program over 4 days with around 35 participants.

We are looking for volunteers who are motivated to help us organize the retreat!
Please write to [vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch) if you are interested!
