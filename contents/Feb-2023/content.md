## ðŸ”Š New VMI Helpdesk

The helpdesk is a confidential service run by volunteers from the department, who provide a listening ear from colleague to colleague.
The desk is an entry point for early-stage discussion of personal and professional issues.
We can help you find a path forward through listening, advice, and tips on the relevant offices and services available at ETH.

The helpdesk is a safe space and is strictly confidential.
No information is shared outside of the helpdesk's volunteers without your consent.

Do not hesitate to drop us an email at [vmi-helpdesk@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-helpdesk@lists.inf.ethz.ch).
