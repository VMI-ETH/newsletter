Dear VMI members,

As the start of the semester approaches, our [new VMI helpdesk](#new-vmi-helpdesk) is ready for you, and we welcome [our new treasurer](#new-vmi-treasurer), Giovanni!

To kick-start the spring semester, we'd love to see you for drinks and a [pub quiz](https://forms.gle/tvaqqpJVTyAq71Jb9) at The Alehouse!

-- Your VMI Board
