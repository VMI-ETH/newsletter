Dear VMI members,

As November concludes with the [Career Evening](#career-evening), Zurich is transforming into a winter wonderland! The fog gives ways to the cheerful Christmas markets, the scent of Glühwein fills the air (e.g. during the [D-INFK Glühwein-Apéro](#d-infk-gluhwein-apero)), and the first snow has gently blanketed the city, dressing it in its finest white coat. The holiday spirit is here, and so are we—with exciting updates and an invitation to join us for our cherished December tradition: the [Christmas Crafts](#christmas-crafts).

Let’s make this season merry and bright together!

Warm wishes,
-- Your VMI Board
