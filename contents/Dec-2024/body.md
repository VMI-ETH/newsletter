### Running Dinner

**December XX, your house (dinner) and OAT (afterparty), 18:00**

VMI invites you to *Running Dinner* â€“ the tastiest way to meet new people!

At the running dinner, you will eat a three-course dinner during the evening (while preparing one of these courses yourself), followed by an after-party at OAT with everyone who participated in the running dinner!

Team up with a partner (office mate, flat mate, ...) and cook *one* course at your place for you and four other people.
You will go to someone else's place for the other courses, and will host two other teams for the course that you cook.
Overall, you meet twelve people during the evening!
There even is a Wikipedia entry for [Running Dinners](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Dinner) ([English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_dinner))!

[More information & sign up here](website event post).
We raffle grocery vouchers among early sign-ups!
