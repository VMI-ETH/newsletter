### Join a departmental committee!

The scientific staff organization (VMI) is looking for new representatives on two committees:

* The Department Conference, which is the highest decision-making body of D-INFK.
* The Studies Committee, which is tasked with matters related to tuition in the department.

Joining the committees can be rewarded with credit points. It is also a great way to get to know how the department works. If you are interested, please contact us.
