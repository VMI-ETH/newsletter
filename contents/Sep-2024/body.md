### Welcome Event

**Date TBD, [Dozentenfoyer](https://ethz.ch/de/campus/erleben/gastronomie-und-einkaufen/gastronomie/restaurants-und-cafeterias/zentrum/dozentenfoyer.html)**

If you joined D-INFK within the last year, you're invited to our annual Welcome Event for new scientific staff!

It's a great chance to get to know the department and VMI, meet fellow new staff members, and enjoy an apÃ©ro together. We'll also have keynote talks from D-INFK professors on how to make the most of your time at ETH, how to organise your teaching and research responsibilities, and much more.
