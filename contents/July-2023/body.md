Work on the VMI board can be voluntary, but can also be compensated with teaching or credit points!

You'll get exciting insights into politics at ETHZ and our department, and you can organise fun events for your colleagues - such as the summer retreat!

### Doctoral Student Salaries

Earlier this year, doctoral students at ETH ZÃ¼rich received their first inflation adjustment of 2.5% since 2014.
Simultaneously, ETH ZÃ¼rich formed a working group to explore options for restructuring the current doctoral salary system.
AVETH represents all doctoral students in this working group and recently gave [an update](https://www.aveth.ethz.ch/politics/doctoral-students-salary-structure/) on the working group's progress.
