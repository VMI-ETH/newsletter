Dear VMI members,

It was great to see so many of you at our VMI BBQ in June.
With 47 registered participants, it was our biggest BBQ so far, and we had great fun.
We hope you did, too!

If you would like to help us with events like this, why don't you join our board?
Work on our board can be compensated with a teaching point or credit points.
We are looking for new members to join us!

-- Your VMI Board
