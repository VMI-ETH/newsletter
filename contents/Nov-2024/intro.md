Dear VMI members,

Days are becoming shorter and shorter, temperature is slowly going down, fog is dense in the morning... Yes, all signs that we're well into the Autumn season now!

If you're interested in what we got up to during our annual summer retreat, check out our [Summer Retreat 2024 Retrospective](https://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2023/09/19/summer-retreat-retrospective/).

We wish you a cosy November!

-- Your VMI Board
