### New VMI Board and Representatives

In October, we held our bi-annual General Assembly and elected a new VMI board!

We welcome:

* Graciana Aad (System Security Group) and
* Yutong Chen (Computer Vision and Learning Group)


Nabil Abubaker and Alexandre Binninger took the role of co-president of VMI, and Sverrir Thorgeirsson is now VMI's treasurer.

At the same time, Felix Linker stepped down from presidency, Giovanni Deligios from treasurer, Linard Arquint and Ahn Duong Vo from their positions on the board. Quite a turnover! Thank you all for the years you dedicated to VMI!

Changes to VMI's constitution were voted and the new version can be found [here](https://vmi.ethz.ch/constitution/).
