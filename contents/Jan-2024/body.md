### What course do you TA or take next semester?

We are looking for one or two new board members.
On the VMI board, you can gain exciting insights into the politics of ETH and our department, support your colleagues in problems, and organize fun events at which you can get to know new institutes of our department.

Example activities of VMI include:

- Salary negotiations with ETH Zurich for Doctoral students as part of the salary working group with AVETH
- Design of teaching evaluations of teaching assistants at our department
- Organizing the summer retreat with around 64 participants
- Welcoming new members of our department with welcome bags and at the welcome event

Work on the VMI board can be voluntary, but can also be compensated with one teaching point or up to four credit points, i.e., it can be a replacement both for taking courses and offering them.
If you are interested, get in touch: [vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)

### New Helpdesk Volunteer

Martino Sindaci, our previous volunteer for the VMI helpdesk, left our department and hence stepped down from running the helpdesk.
Thanks for all your work, Martino!

In the meantime, [Dhruv Nevatia](https://notdhruv.github.io/) volunteered to take over, and has just finished his counseling training at AVETH!

The VMI helpdesk can help you with all kinds of problems.
Dhruv now knows the various points of contacts at ETH inside out.
Should you find problems at your workplace, your Doctorate, or your employment, Dhruv can probably tell you where you can find help.
Don't hesitate to reach out!
