### What course should you teach or take next semester? Join the VMI Board!

We are looking for one or two new board members.
As a VMI board member, you can gain exciting insights into the politics of ETH and your department, support your colleagues, and organize fun events through which you can meet people from other institutes.

Example activities of VMI include:

- Negotiating salaries for Doctoral students as part of the salary working group with AVETH
- Designing teaching evaluations for the teaching assistants in our department
- Organizing the summer retreat for around 64 participants
- Welcoming new members of the department with welcome bags and at the welcome event

Work on the VMI board can be voluntary, but it can also be compensated with one teaching point or up to four credit points i.e., it can be a replacement for both taking courses and offering them.
If you are interested, get in touch: [vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)

### New Helpdesk Volunteer

Martino Sindaci, our previous volunteer for the VMI helpdesk, left our department and hence stepped down from running the helpdesk.
Thanks for all your work, Martino!

[Dhruv Nevatia](https://notdhruv.github.io/) volunteered to take over, and has just finished his counseling training at AVETH!

The VMI helpdesk can help you with all kinds of problems.
Dhruv now knows the various points of contacts at ETH inside out.
Should you find problems in your workplace, your Doctorate, or your employment, Dhruv can tell you where you can find help.
Don't hesitate to reach out!
