Dear colleagues,

We hope you had relaxing holidays and slid well into the new year (as one would say here in Switzerland)!

Should you still be looking for new year's resolutions, can we suggest joining the VMI board?
It is great fun and can be an alternative to teaching or taking courses!
See below for more information, or chat with us at our event in January: Bowling!

-- Your VMI Board
