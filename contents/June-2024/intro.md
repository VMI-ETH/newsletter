Dear colleagues,

Summer is just around the corner and to kickstart it we're excited to announce both the [summer retreat registration date](#vmi-summer-retreat-registration) and our annual [VMI summer BBQ](#vmi-summer-bbq)!

Also, we invite you to consider joining the VMI board!
Work on the VMI board is fun, gives you new insights into ETH and department politics, and can award you with a teaching point.
Read on to learn more about that.

-- Your VMI Board
