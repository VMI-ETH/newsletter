## Join the VMI Board!

The VMI executive board is looking for new members for the fall semester!
In particular, we are looking for both **board members** and a new **treasurer**.
As a VMI board member, you can gain exciting insights into the politics of ETH and your department, support your colleagues, and organize fun events through which you can meet people from other institutes.

Example activities of VMI include:

- Organizing the summer retreat for around 64 participants
- Welcoming new members of the department with welcome bags and at the welcome event
- Becoming active in ETH politics, e.g., by providing feedback to proposed, new measures, or serving in various boards

Work on the VMI board can be voluntary, but it can also be compensated with one teaching point or up to four credit points i.e., it can be a replacement for both taking courses and offering them.
If you are interested, get in touch: [vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)
