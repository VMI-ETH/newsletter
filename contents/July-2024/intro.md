Dear colleagues,

The Spring Semester is now over and we're entering the second part of the year. We're excited to announce that we will host our first edition of the [Academic Success Event](#academic-success), where you can come and discuss the topic of success in academia with our panelists, and even enjoy an ap√©ro!

Also, we invite you to consider joining the VMI board!
Work on the VMI board is fun, gives you new insights into ETH and department politics, and can award you with a teaching point.
Read on to learn more about that.
