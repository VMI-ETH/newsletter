<img style="margin:0em 0em 1em 1em" align="center" src="https://vmi.ethz.ch/images/vmi-academic-success-2024.jpg" width="90%">

Especially young researchers often wonder about their role.
What is the purpose of academia in society?
What makes a PhD fulfilling?
How do you define success in academia? What is important to you, and how do you measure academic achievements?
Join us on **Thursday, July 11, 17:15** at Food&Lab (CAB H 41) for an evening where we discuss the multifaceted dimensions of happiness and success in academia!

We start with a discussion between high-quality panelists with diverse backgrounds. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to ask all the questions you want and even interact on a more personal level within small groups during an ApÃ©ro!

Interested? [Sign-up here](https://forms.gle/GgE1CJxbdave34LW9)! You can find more information about our panelists on [our website](https://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2024/06/25/academic-success/).
