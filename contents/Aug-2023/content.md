## ðŸ“… Upcoming Events

### Outdoor Paint and Sip Night

**August 21, [Landiwiese](https://goo.gl/maps/NdGMJ1bC8QPoWqvH6), 18:30**

Join us for a relaxed evening of painting and sipping by the lake!

Weâ€™ll provide everything you need to get creative: canvas, paints, brushes, ideas on what to paint - plus drinks and snacks!

In case of bad weather, weâ€™ll paint in CAB â€” weâ€™ll send out an email closer to the time with the final location.

Spots are limited, so sign up fast! We'll email you if you get a spot.

### ETHZ Lunchmates

AMB, the association for scientific staff at D-BIOL, together with other DAs, started *lunchmates*.
If you want to meet other doctoral students and postdocs from other DAs, look no further!

As soon as you sign up to the lunchmates community, you will be assigned to new lunch buddies on your campus every 2 weeks.
