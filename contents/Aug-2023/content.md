### Outdoor Paint and Sip Night

**August 21, [Landiwiese](https://goo.gl/maps/NdGMJ1bC8QPoWqvH6), 18:30**

Join us for a relaxed evening of painting and sipping by the lake!

Weâ€™ll provide everything you need to get creative: canvas, paints, brushes, ideas on what to paint - plus drinks and snacks!

In case of bad weather, weâ€™ll paint in CAB â€” weâ€™ll send out an email closer to the time with the final location.

Spots are limited, so sign up fast! We'll email you if you get a spot.
