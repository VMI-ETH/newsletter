## Summer Retreat 2022

We had so much fun at our annual Summer Retreat in September!
Around 70 of our members got together in Interlaken for four days of networking, socialising and exploring Switzerland.
To see what we got up to, check out our [Summer Retreat 2022 Retrospective](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2022/09/27/summer-retreat-retrospective/).
We're looking forward to seeing more of you at next year's retreat!
