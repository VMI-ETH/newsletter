Dear VMI members,

A warm welcome to Fall Semester 2023 from VMI, your association of scientific staff at D-INFK! In this monthly newsletter, we'll tell you about our exciting upcoming events. We have plenty of fun events lined up for October to give you a chance to meet new people and reconnect with old friends. We hope to see you at one of them soon! 

-- Your VMI Board
