Dear colleagues,

As the weather warms up, are you already missing the crisp chill of winter? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered! Join us for an ice skating event in early March to embrace the last of the winter vibes.

Prefer something a little less slippery? Dive into our Adaptive Leadership Workshop, where you’ll gain the tools and strategies to turn your vision into reality—no ice-related collisions involved!

And to wrap up the month, don’t miss our Spring General Assembly!

We look forward to seeing you,

-- Your VMI Board
