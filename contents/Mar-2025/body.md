### Tips of the month: nutrition basics to be mastered for a healthy time at ETH

As researchers at ETH, we’re often juggling experiments, lectures, and tight deadlines, which can make grabbing a quick bite tempting. But good nutrition fuels your brain and body for the long haul. Enter our well-being events series—we kicked it off with a nutrition workshop hosted by a nutritionist! We explored the essentials of nutrition and health, and we’ve distilled some key takeaways for you below.

* Embrace a Variety of Food Categories: A balanced diet with diverse food groups—think veggies, fruits, whole grains, proteins, and healthy fats—ensures you’re getting the vitamins and minerals needed for sharp thinking and stamina. Mix it up to keep your plate colorful and your mind engaged!  
* Skip the Processed Stuff When You Can: It’s easy to reach for packaged snacks or ready-made meals when you’re swamped, but processed foods are often loaded with sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Opt for whole foods instead—they’ll keep your energy steady, not crashing mid-code review.  
* Hydrate Like It’s Lab Protocol: Water is your secret weapon—aim for enough liters a day (more if you’re caffeinating hard). It boosts concentration, fights fatigue, and keeps you from mistaking thirst for hunger during that 4 p.m. slump.

**Fun Fact**: Your gut and brain are in constant communication via the gut-brain axis—eating well doesn’t just fuel your body, it literally helps you think better. Call it nature’s own optimization algorithm!
