Dear VMI members,

Just a week ago, VMI held its General Assembly at which three new board members were elected.
We warmly welcome:

* Alexandre Binninger (Interactive Geometry Lab),
* Francesca Falzon (Applied Cryptography Group), and
* Sverrir Thorgeirsson (Advanced Software Technologies Lab).

At the same time, Matilda Backendal, long and active VMI member and former president, decided to step down from her position on the executive board.
Thank you, Matilda, for your years of great work!

We hope to see you at one of our two amazing events: the [Career Evening](#career-evening) and the [Christmas Crafts & Gl√ºhwein](#christmas-crafts-gluhwein).

Have a lovely December

-- Your VMI Board
