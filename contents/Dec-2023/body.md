## ðŸ”Š Announcements

### New VMI Board

Just a week ago, VMI held its General Assembly at which three new board members were elected.
We warmly welcome:

* Alexandre Binninger (Interactive Geometry Lab),
* Francesca Falzon (Applied Cryptography Group), and
* Sverrir Thorgeirsson (Advanced Software Technologies Lab).

At the same time, Matilda Backendal, long an active VMI member and former president, decided to step down from her position on the executive board.
Thank you, Matilda, for your years of great work!

### Salary Increases for Doctoral Students

Earlier this month, ETH announced that the salaries of Doctoral students will be decoupled from the SNF rate and receive the same adjustments for inflation as all other staff in 2024.
(See the announcement [here](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/news-and-events/internal-news/archive/2023/11/salary-adjustments-for-scientific-assistants.html).)
This change was a result from negotiations within the salary working, which was formed earlier this year.
AVETH represented all scientific staff in this working group, and VMI was part of AVETH's team, representing you, the scientific staff of D-INFK.

Work in the salary working group will continue, and it is VMI's and AVETH's goal that doctoral students receive the same adjustments for inflation as all other employees beyond 2024!

If you would like to receive more updates from AVETH's representatives at the working group, you can [sign up for updates here](https://forms.gle/q6mKCQYB6nwzH3CB9).
