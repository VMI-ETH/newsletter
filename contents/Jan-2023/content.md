### Juggling Workshop

**Tuesday, January 31, 18:30, CAB H52**

Do you want to learn a new skill this year? Join us for a juggling workshop, where you can learn to juggle with self-made juggling balls! 

It's a great way to actively relax, impress your friends and family, and just have fun. 

Weâ€™ll provide everything needed to create your own juggling balls, and then instruct you how to learn to juggle. There will be snacks and drinks.
