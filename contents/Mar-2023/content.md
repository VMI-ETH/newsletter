### Get Involved - Open Positions on the VMI Board

We are looking for new VMI board members who want to join *now*.
You can **join the executive board or become a representative** at the DK or UK ([details about these committees](http://vmi.ethz.ch/committees/)).

Joining VMI is a great opportunity to help make D-INFK a better workplace, learn about ETH politics, and also have some fun!

[Get in touch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch) should you be interested.

### Summer Retreat 2023

**September 9-12 and 14-17, Laax, Switzerland**

Every year, VMI hosts our famous Summer Retreat, which brings together D-INFK scientific staff for 4 days of fun, networking, science and learning. We're excited to announce that this year's Summer Retreat will be in Laax! 

The retreat is fully supported by the department, so there's no need to take vacation days to attend. 

Save the date and look out for more details coming soon! 

To see what we got up to in previous years, have a look at the [2022](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2022/09/27/summer-retreat-retrospective/) and [2021](http://vmi.ethz.ch/news/event/2022/02/21/summer-retreat-retrospective/) retreat retrospectives. 

### Teaching Survey

In the next weeks, VMI will launch a **teaching survey**.
The goal of this survey is to understand how you spend your time on teaching.

The results of this survey will help us improve the teaching points system and balance teaching load across the department and courses.
Please fill it in as soon as you receive it!

### Closing the VMI Slack

We will close the VMI Slack for the public in the next weeks.
The Slack has been a great asset in times of pandemic when hallway chatter vanished.
Since the return to offices activity slowly faded, which led to our decision to close it.

You can as always reach us by [mail](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch) or contact our new [VMI helpdesk](http://vmi.ethz.ch/contact/#helpdesk).
