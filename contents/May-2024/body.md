### VMI Summer Retreat 2024

We are excited to announce the VMI Summer Retreat 2024, which will take place in the stunning location **Zermatt** on **September 7-10 and 12-15**!
Registration opens in June.

The VMI Summer Retreat is for all scientific staff at the Department of Computer Science.
It is a great opportunity to meet other members of our department, learn about their research, and have some fun.
Participation only costs CHF 60, which covers most expenses of the retreat, including accommodation, and most meals.

### WiegETHs/HowsETHgoing?

The new *wiegETHs* survey is out! VSETH and AVETH want to know more about how you are doing and how we can better support you. Are your studies or work stressing you out? Do you have enough free time? Can you manage financially? Do you feel like you can be yourself? It's important for us to know this.

**Please fill in the anonymous survey that was sent to you via e-mail**, and help us make ETH a better and more welcoming place for everyone!

More information on the survey can be found [here](https://vseth.ethz.ch/politics/wiegeths-howsethgoing/)!
