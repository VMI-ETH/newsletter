### WiegETHs/HowsETHgoing?

Have you already filled in the survey?

The new wiegETHs survey is out. VSETH and AVETH want to know more about how you are doing and how we can better support you in your studies and work at ETH. Are your studies or work stressing you out? Is it too much stress? Do you have enough free time? Can you manage financially? Do you feel like you can be yourself? It's important for us to know this.

**Please fill in the anonymous survey that was sent to you via e-mail**, and help us make ETH a better and more welcoming place for everyone!

More information on the survey can be found under the following link: [link](https://vseth.ethz.ch/politics/wiegeths-howsethgoing/)
