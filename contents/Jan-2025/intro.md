Dear VMI members,

Is there a better Christmas gift than a Newsletter from your favorite association? We hope you are having a relaxing holiday and we look forward to meeting you in the new year! Why not join us for next month's tasty event: the Running Dinner?

Should you still be looking for new year's resolutions, can we suggest joining the VMI board? It is great fun and can be an alternative to teaching or taking courses! See below for more information.

See you in 2025, hopefully relaxed and refreshed for an exciting new year!

-- Your VMI Board
