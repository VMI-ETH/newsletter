Dear VMI members,

Is there a better Christmas gift than a Newsletter from your favorite association? We hope you are having a relaxing holiday and are looking forward to meet you in the next year! Why not meeting during our next month's tasty event: the Running Dinner?

Should you still be looking for new year's resolutions, can we suggest joining the VMI board? It is great fun and can be an alternative to teaching or taking courses! See below for more information.

See you in 2025, hopefully relaxed and refreshed for an exciting new year!

-- Your VMI Board
