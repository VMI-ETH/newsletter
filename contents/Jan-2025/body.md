### What course should you teach or take next semester? Join the VMI Board instead!

VMI board member veterans are leaving, so new spots on the board are opening! Don't miss out on this opportunity!

As a VMI board member, you can gain exciting insights into the politics of ETH and your department, support your colleagues, and organize fun events through which you can meet people from other institutes.

Example activities of VMI include:

- Organizing social or educational events to foster a positive environment within the department,
- Preparing the summer retreat for around 75 participants in a wonderful Swiss mountain village,
- Welcoming new members of the department with welcome bags and at the welcome event,

You will be able to shape VMI so that it offers what you believe is the best to its members!

Work on the VMI board can be voluntary, but it can also be **compensated with one teaching point** or up to four credit points (2 per semesters) i.e., it can be a replacement for both taking courses and offering them.
If you are interested or have any question about the positions, get in touch at [vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)

We want to cater to your needs, so we need to know about them!

VMI is committed to organize events focused on academic excellence, professional education, and well-being. We want to be sure that we dedicate our efforts to solve real problems. Is there any domain in which you would like to get more support?
To help us design our future events in the scope of these objectives, we would be grateful if you took 5 min to complete [this very short survey](https://forms.gle/A7qEXV1XTSuNmz8A9). 

In the past, VMI organized a lot of such workshops. You can have a glance at these [here](https://vmi.ethz.ch/wellbeing/) if you want to have a better idea about what we're talking about.

VMI invites you to *Running Dinner* â€“ the tastiest way to meet new people!

At the running dinner, you will eat a three-course dinner during the evening (while preparing one of these courses yourself), followed by an after-party at OAT with everyone who participated in the running dinner!

Team up with a partner (office mate, flat mate, ...) and cook *one* course at your place for you and four other people.
You will go to someone else's place for the other courses, and will host two other teams for the course that you cook.
Overall, you meet twelve people during the evening!
There even is a Wikipedia entry for [Running Dinners](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Dinner) ([English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_dinner))!
