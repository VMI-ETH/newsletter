Dear colleagues,

We wish you a happy Easter weekend and hope that you are looking forward to it!

In April, there will be more faculty candidates to interview.
This time, the candidates are for Theoretical Computer Science.

Should you want to learn something practical to contrast these interviews, why not join our juggling event?

We wish you a lovely start into the spring,

-- Your VMI Board
