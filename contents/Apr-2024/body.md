### What is the VMI Helpdesk?

About half a year ago, our new helpdesk volunteer, Dhruv Nevatia, took over.
Since then, we learned that many of our colleagues don't know about its existence or role.
The VMI helpdesk is there to help you with all kinds of problems.
Dhruv now knows the various points of contact at ETH inside out.
Should you find problems in your workplace, your Doctorate, or your employment, Dhruv can tell you where you can find help.
Don't hesitate to reach out!

### Join the AVETH Politics Team

The AVETH poltics team is looking for new members, especially from D-INFK!

To coordinate, the team meets once per month.

Joining the politics team not only lets you have a unique impact at how work and life at ETH is shaped, but also provides great insight into the inner workings of a world-class university.
