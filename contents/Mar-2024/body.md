### Interview Faculty Candidates

Our department is hiring new faculty in **Computing Platforms** and there will soon be a second round of interviews with candidates.
We invite you to **interview the candidates in CAB on the 12th and 13th of March**.
You will both present the department to the candidate, i.e., share your opinion and experiences at the department and gain an impression of the candidate.
