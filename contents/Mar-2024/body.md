### Interview Faculty Candidates

Our department is hiring new faculty in **Computing Platforms** and there will soon be a second round of interviews with candidates.
We invite you to **interview the candidates in CAB on the 12th and 13th of March**.
You will both present the department to the candidate, i.e., share your opinion and experiences at the department and gain an impression of the candidate.

If you are interested in joining these interviews, please fill in **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEKHnWMhR7iqFXa-49Vk_G4rfgm6Vihr8CrWtBY11rW3Zibw/viewform?usp=sf_link) by the 6th of March**.
You can sign-up for multiple slots, and each slot is for a different candidate.
We will reach out to you later and confirm which slots you can attend and provide you with more details for the day.
