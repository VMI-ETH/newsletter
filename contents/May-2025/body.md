### Tips of the Month: Mindful Transitions Between Tasks

As researchers at ETH, weâ€™re often deep in thought, shifting between tasks, and racing against deadlines. Itâ€™s easy to stay in go-modeâ€”but even brief pauses can make a big difference. This month's well-being tip is about the power of Mindful Transitionsâ€”a simple habit that can help reduce burnout and sharpen focus.

**Pause Between Tasks:** Give your brain a moment to reset before switching contexts. Just 60â€“90 seconds of stillnessâ€”whether itâ€™s deep breathing, standing up, or stepping away from your screenâ€”can help clear mental clutter and reduce fatigue.

**Start and End with Intention:** Try creating mini-rituals to begin and close your workday. A quick review of your to-do list in the morning, or a moment of reflection at the end of the day, can help you feel more grounded and in control.

**Presence Over Productivity:** Being fully present in what you're doingâ€”whether it's reading, coding, or collaboratingâ€”can lead to better outcomes and a calmer mind. Mindfulness isnâ€™t about doing less; itâ€™s about doing things with clarity.

**Fun Fact:** Even brief moments of mindfulness can improve working memory and emotional regulation. The brain performs better when itâ€™s given time to breathe! Small moments, big impact!
