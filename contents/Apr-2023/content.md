## ðŸ”Š Announcements

### General Assembly + New Executive Board

We held the VMI General Assembly in March, at which a new executive board was elected.
Matilda Backendal decided to step down as president.
We would like to thank Matilda for her long and outstanding work as a president!
Fortunately, Matilda will stick around as an executive board member.
Also, Bogdan Ursu decided to step down from the executive board.
Thank you for your work!

For newcomers, Anh Duong Vo joined the executive board and Felix Linker was elected as the new VMI president.

### Teaching Survey

We launched the VMI teaching survey recently.
The goal of the survey is to understand better who spends how much time on what kind of tasks.
Please help us by filling out the survey [here](https://evaluation-app1.let.ethz.ch/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=782I7mmM)!
The survey is authenticated in order to ensure the integrity of the results, and you can log in using your ETH password for web applications (AAI/LDAP).
All data will be anonymised.

You can find more details about the survey [here](http://vmi.ethz.ch/teaching-survey/).

### Experience Report: Aptitude Colloquia

At every VMI Welcome Event, new doctoral students ask us: What is this aptitude colloquium that I must attend?
To provide you with a feeling for the aptitude colloquia, our board member Linard Arquint attended some of them and wrote an [experience report](https://vmi.ethz.ch/aptitude-colloquium/) for you.

You can find all regulations regarding the aptitude colloquium [here](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/doctoral-study-program/doctoral_research.html).
