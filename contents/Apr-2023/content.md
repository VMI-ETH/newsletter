### Random Lunches

**Get to know 1-2 new people, flexible in April during lunch time, flexible lunch place**

Meet new people in the ETH Computer Science department by joining us for our Random Lunches event! We'll match you up with 1-2 buddies from different institutes within the department.

Once you sign up, we'll give you the email contacts of your new lunch buddies. You can decide on a date and place to get together for lunch sometime in April. There is no participation fee but VMI cannot pay for the lunch.

[Sign up here by 10th April.](https://forms.gle/dxAHdHzmcTZWjVdZ7)
