Dear VMI members,

A warm welcome to Fall Semester 2024 from VMI, your association of scientific staff at D-INFK! In this monthly newsletter, we'll tell you about our exciting upcoming events. We have plenty of events lined up for October to help new ETH scientific staff kick off their start at ETH, such as one to prepare your coming addiction to caffeine! We hope to see you at one of them soon! 

-- Your VMI Board
